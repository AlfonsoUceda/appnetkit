AppNetKit
=========

AppNetKit is an Objective-C library for communicating with the App.net Stream API. It is completely asynchronous, using blocks to notify you of completions.

AppNetKit currently only supports a very few features, but the general outlines ought to be visible.  There are a *lot* of commented-out API calls that might give you an idea of the direction I'm going.

Some of the highlights:

ANAuthenticator
-------------

This is an OAuth helper singleton. Set the client ID and redirect URL, then use the other methods to help you generate OAuth URLs and parse out the accessToken from the response.

ANSession
--------

Basis of the API. Set the accessToken, then use the other methods to access parts of the API. +[ANSession defaultSession] is a convenience method for the common case where you're using only one session for the whole app; you can also allocate several different ANSessions and use them separately.

ANSession also manages UIApplication's network activity indicator. This should probably be configurable in various ways, not the least because it's the only way in which this library depends on iOS-specific APIs.

ANResource, ANUser, and ANPost
----------------------------

ANResource represents anything the server sends as a JSON object. ANUser and ANPost are subclasses for the Stream API's User and Post objects, respectively.

ANRequest and subclasses
---------------------

ANRequest subclasses represent specific API requests. You don't normally have to use them--ANSession has APIs for common requests--but they are public API, and using them directly can give you finer control than ANSession allows.

Patches
======

Will ultimately be welcome, but this early on I'd just like bug fixes and reorganization (this is begging for an ANErrors.h), because I want to direct the design of the API a little more. If you're *really* sure you know what I would do, feel free to submit a pull request.
